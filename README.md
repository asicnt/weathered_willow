Here's my pitch

You see a lil pixelart tavern interior

Bar, tables, stairs in the back maybe

You're an innkeeper

You gotta manage mead and ale and wine prices

And menu options maybe

Ingredients and prices

And people either buy your stuff or dont

And you can expand

Every once in a while, some traveling minstrel or jester or companion hangs out in the bar to entertain guests

Somehow if they like you, you can convince them to kind of work for you informally

Independent contractor

And your guests would like that because music and jokes and companion
